### Features:

1. Extend the first level
	Level should include enough terrain to take a few minutes for a competent player to complete, including pickups and enemies.
1. Make slimes killable
	Enemies will die, including an animation (and sound?) when killed, by jumping on them
1. HUD
	The HUD will follow the camera and show values such as level, coins (and health in the future)
1. Implement lives
	Users will begin with three lives
	Coins will be collected and not reappear on respawn and score will persist between lives
	Once lives == 0, game over and coins, score and lives reset
1. Game over
	Displays once player dies, clickable button to start again
1. Level tranistion
	Add a new level to first world. At the end of the first level, a portal allows users to transition to next level
1. Add worlds
	Add multiple worlds and world select menu into start/game over
